## **WaongDaong: An AI-Powered English Learning Platform**

**WaongDaong** is a groundbreaking AI-powered platform designed to shift the focus of English education from **"English for exams"** to **"English for life"**. The project aims to combat student disengagement by addressing the lack of relevant content and community support, which are common issues in traditional learning environments. WaongDaong's core philosophy is to foster intrinsic motivation by fulfilling three psychological needs of learners: **Autonomy**, **Relatedness**, and **Competence**.
